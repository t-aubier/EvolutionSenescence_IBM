## System Requirements

Simulations of the individual-based model are run using C++ (compiler g++ 7.5.0).

Simulations based on the analytical derivations are run using R.

Figures are drawn in R.  


## Installation guide

Install C++: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

Also install the Boost C++ Libraries development files.

On linux:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   ```

Overall installation time is short: < 5 min

## Script description

Oriented-based programming in C++ with modeling of two different classes 'Population' and 'Individual':

* "ClassPopulation.cpp" and "ClassPopulation.h": script defining the class 'Population' referring to a population of individuals; see the header files "ClassPopulation.h" for descriptions of the variables and the functions.

* "ClassIndividual.cpp" and "ClassIndividual.h": script defining the class 'ClassIndividual' referring a single individual; see the header files "ClassIndividual.h" for descriptions of the variables and the functions.

* "OtherFunctions.cpp" and "OtherFunctions.h": script defining additional basic functions (e.g., calculation of mean, generation of random numbers); see the header files "OtherFunctions.h" for descriptions of the functions.

* The script "Simulation_Accumulation.cpp" is used to run forward simulations. All variables are described in the functions 'main' within this file.

* The script "Sensitivity_Accumulation.cpp" is used to run a sensitivity analysis (variations of mortality and birth rates). All variables are described in the functions 'main' within this file.

In the folder "AnalysisR", the R script to draw graphs resulting from the simulations using R language.

* "Function_Pleiotropy.R":			                       Plot the factor change in fecundity depending on the age at which intrinsic mortality occurs (Figure B1 in Appendix B)

* "Plot_AccumulationMutations_AnalyticalDerivations.R":     Plot the accumulation of lethal mutations and the maximum lifespan for different grains of age dependence of mutation expression (Figures 1 and 2)

* "Plot_SingleSimulation.R":                                  Plot figures describing the outcome of single simulations (like in Figs. B4 and B5 in Appendix B); obtained using 'Simulation_Accumulation.cpp'

* "Plot_SensitivityAnalysis.R":                                       Plot figures describing the sensitivity analyses (like in Fig. B2); obtained using 'Sensitivity_Accumulation.cpp'



## Demo and instructions for use

All functions are written in the script files "ClassIndividual.cpp" and "ClassPopulation.cpp" (see the header files "ClassIndividual.h" and "ClassPopulation.h" for descriptions of the variables and the functions). This file must remain untouched. Additional functions are written in the files "OtherFunctions.cpp" and "OtherFunctions.h". All these files must remain untouched.

Simulations are run using the scripts "Simulation_Accumulation.cpp" or "Sensitivity_Accumulation.cpp". One can change parameter values there. The command line (in Linux) is:

   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++14 -O2  Simulation_Accumulation.cpp ClassPopulation.cpp ClassIndividual.cpp OtherFunctions.cpp
   ./a.out
   ```

   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++14 -O2  Sensitivity_Accumulation.cpp ClassPopulation.cpp ClassIndividual.cpp OtherFunctions.cpp
   ./a.out
   ```

Data are then stored in the folder "Data".

In the folder "AnalysisR", use the R script to draw graphs resulting from the simulations using R language.


## Simulation experiments

Note that to draw the figures shown in the manuscript, considerable computing power was needed (via the use of a computing cluster; each simulation typically lasted few days). That is why the figures created by the Demo code are different from the ones in the manuscript (so that the sensitivity analysis is done in less than one day). To reproduce the figures in the manuscript, one can change the parameter values to match the default values (default value are commented in the code).
